= Introduction =

Routerdefense validates the security configuration of IOS devices.

The user must provides a "show run" to the tool.

Reporting supported formats are stdout, html5, csv and pdf.

[pythonRequirements Python version and modules requirements]

= Run the tool =

The simplest method is to use the run_routerdefense script. 

{{{
$ more run_routerdefense
#! /bin/sh
DIR=$(dirname $0)
PYTHONPATH=$DIR exec python -B main.py -c show_run.txt -t routerdefense.conf
}}}

_show_run.txt_ is the Cisco IOS device configuration file.<br />
[routerdefenseconf routerdefense.conf] is a configuration file to tune the routerdefense tool.

$ *./run_routerdefense*

= Specific security checks =

The other method is to use the only{{{*}}}.py scripts with the Cisco IOS device configuration file as argument.

$ *python -B onlyCONSOLE.sh show_run.txt*
